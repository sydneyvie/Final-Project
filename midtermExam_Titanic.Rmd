# Load data and packages
```{r set up}

library(tidyverse) 
# for loading data, data management, and ggplot2

titanic <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kijohnson/Data/main/titanic.csv")
# import Titanic dataset from GitHub

```

# Determine median age by passenger class
The median age differs by passenger class. The median age in passenger class 1 is 38.5 years. The median age in passenger class 2 is 29.0 years. The median age in passenger class 3 is 24.0 years.
```{r}

titanic$Pclass <- as.factor(titanic$Pclass)
# convert passenger class from a numeric to a factor variable 

medianAgeByClass <- titanic %>% 
  group_by(Pclass) %>% 
  summarise(medianAge = median(Age))
medianAgeByClass
# determine the median age grouped by passenger class

```

# Use a boxplot to visualize age according to passenger class
```{r}

ageClass <- ggplot(data = titanic, aes(x = Pclass, y = Age, fill = Pclass)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Median age by passenger class", 
       x = "Passenger class", y = "Age (years)", 
       fill = "Passenger class") +
  theme_minimal()
ageClass
# create a boxplot to visualize the medians, spread, and outliers of age by passenger class

```
